This is a assignment where a topology is being implemented

This is not a linear topology

1 switch is connected to 2 hosts
and all the switches are connected in cicular fashion
where only the even hosts can communicate with even hosts and odd with odd ones only
the various bandwith modulation is being applied to it

The topology thus created works according to the given requirements.

Here we can connect any number of switches
